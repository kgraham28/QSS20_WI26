    "- [Review of sentencing disparities research](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/701505)\n",
    "- [Discussion of causal model/blinding race at charging stage of the prosecutorial process](https://5harad.com/papers/blind-charging.pdf)\n",
    "- [Discussion of measuring discrimination in policing that can generalize to the sentencing case](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-criminol-011518-024731)\n",
    "- [General discussion of causal challenges in measuring between-group disparities](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gx4y3/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**One major caveat**: when investigating whether two similar defendants received different sentences, we're missing one important attribute that influences sentencing: the defendant's criminal history. This influences sentencing both through sentencing guidelines, which can prescribe longer sentences for those who have certain types of prior convictions, and through judicial discretion if judges are more lenient with first-time defendants. The above sources discuss how much we want to \"control away\" for this prior history, since if we think there are racial biases in which defendants, conditional on *committing* a crime, are arrested and charged, we may not want to adjust for that factor.
