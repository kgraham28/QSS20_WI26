      "| **Loose Coupling** | Changes inside the provider can often be made without breaking the consumer, as long as the public contract stays the same. |\n",

      "|------|------------------|---------|\n",
      "| **Web / HTTP APIs** | Expose services over the Internet (REST, GraphQL, SOAP). | Twitter’s REST API for posting tweets. |\n",
      "| **Library / SDK APIs** | Functions/classes a developer can call from within a program. | The `java.util.Collections` class in the Java Standard Library. |\n",
      "| **Operating System APIs** | System‑level services (file I/O, networking, UI). | Win32 API, POSIX `open()`/`read()`. |\n",
      "| **Hardware APIs** | Communicate with devices (sensors, GPUs). | OpenGL/Vulkan graphics APIs. |\n",
      "| **Database APIs** | Query and manipulate data stores. | JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), MongoDB driver. |\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## How a Web API Usually Works\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Endpoint URL** – The address you send a request to, e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1/users`.  \n",
      "2. **HTTP Method** – `GET` (read), `POST` (create), `PUT/PATCH` (update), `DELETE` (remove).  \n",
      "3. **Headers** – Metadata such as authentication tokens (`Authorization: Bearer …`) or content type (`Content-Type: application/json`).  \n",
      "4. **Request Body** – Data you send, often JSON or XML.  \n",
      "5. **Response** – The server returns a status code (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`) and a payload (usually JSON).  \n",
      "\n",
      "```http\n",
      "GET /v1/users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",

      "| **Reusability** | One service can be used by many different clients (mobile apps, web front‑ends, other back‑ends). |\n",
      "| **Modularity** | Teams can work on separate components independently, communicating only through the API. |\n",
      "| **Scalability** | Services can be scaled out (e.g., more instances behind a load balancer) without affecting callers. |\n",
      "| **Ecosystem** | Public APIs let third‑parties build extensions, integrations, or entirely new products. |\n",
      "| **Security** | By exposing only a controlled surface, you hide internal implementation details and can enforce authentication/authorization centrally. |\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Real‑World Analogies\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Restaurant Menu** – The menu lists dishes (functions) you can order, along with prices (parameters). You don’t need to know the kitchen’s recipe (implementation); you just place an order (request) and receive the dish (response).  \n",
      "2. **Electric Power Socket** – The socket defines voltage, shape, and plug type (the “interface”). Any compatible plug (device) can draw power without needing to know how the power plant generates electricity.  \n",

      "| **Hard‑coding URLs or credentials** | Store them in environment variables or configuration files; use secrets managers. |\n",
      "| **Ignoring rate limits** | Respect `Retry-After` headers, implement exponential back‑off, and monitor usage. |\n",
      "| **Returning vague error messages** | Use standard HTTP status codes and a consistent error‑body format (e.g., `{ \"error\": \"Invalid token\", \"code\": 401 }`). |\n",
      "| **Not versioning** | Include a version identifier in the URL (`/v1/…`) or in headers, so you can evolve the API without breaking existing clients. |\n",
      "| **Tight coupling to response shape** | Keep client code tolerant of extra fields and missing optional fields; use schema validation when necessary. |\n",

      "## TL;DR\n",
      "\n",
      "- An **API** is a formal contract that lets one software component request functionality from another.  \n",
      "- It abstracts *how* something is done, exposing only *what* can be done and *how* to call it.  \n",
      "- APIs power everything from web services (Twitter, Google Maps) to libraries you import in code (NumPy, React).  \n",

      "**1. Understand the Basics & Legal/Ethical Considerations**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **What *is* Web Scraping?** At its core, it's automatically extracting data from websites.  Instead of manually copying and pasting, you write code to do it for you.\n",
      "* **Why Learn It?**  Data analysis, price monitoring, research, lead generation, content aggregation – the uses are diverse.\n",
      "* **Legality & Ethics - *VERY IMPORTANT!***\n",
      "    * **Terms of Service:** *Always* check a website's `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://www.example.com/robots.txt`) and Terms of Service.  These dictate what you're allowed to scrape.  Respect these rules!\n",
      "    * **Respect Server Load:** Don't bombard a website with requests.  Introduce delays (see \"Best Practices\" below).  Excessive scraping can overload a server and is considered a denial-of-service attack.\n",
      "    * **Copyright:** Be mindful of copyright.  Scraped content is often copyrighted, and you need to use it responsibly.\n",
      "    * **Personal Data:**  Be *extremely* careful when scraping personal data (names, emails, addresses).  You need to comply with privacy regulations (like GDPR, CCPA).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Choose Your Tools/Languages**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several options exist. Here are the most popular:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Python (Most Popular):**  This is *the* dominant language for web scraping.  It's easy to learn, has a huge community, and excellent libraries.\n",
      "    * **Beautiful Soup:**  A library for parsing HTML and XML.  It makes navigating and searching the structure of a webpage much easier. *Great for beginners.*\n",
      "    * **Requests:** A library for making HTTP requests (getting the webpage content).\n",
      "    * **Scrapy:** A powerful *framework* for building scalable and complex web scrapers. It handles many details for you (request scheduling, concurrency, data pipelines). *More advanced.*\n",
      "    * **Selenium:**  Used for scraping dynamic websites (websites that heavily use JavaScript to load content). It automates a web browser. *Slower and more resource-intensive than other methods, but necessary for JavaScript-heavy sites.*\n",
      "* **JavaScript (with Node.js):**  Becoming more popular, especially for full-stack developers.\n",
      "    * **Puppeteer:**  Similar to Selenium; controls a headless Chrome or Chromium browser.\n",
      "    * **Cheerio:** A fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server.  Parses HTML.\n",
      "    * **Axios/Node-fetch:**  For making HTTP requests.\n",
      "* **Other Languages:** Ruby, PHP, Java, etc., can also be used, but they're less common for web scraping.\n",

      "* **Python Basics:** If you're new to Python, start with a tutorial.  (See \"Resources\" below)  Focus on:\n",
      "    * Variables, data types (strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries)\n",
      "    * Control flow (if/else statements, loops)\n",
      "    * Functions\n",
      "    * Modules (how to import and use libraries)\n",
      "* **HTTP Requests (with `requests`):**\n",
      "    * Learn how to send a GET request to a URL.\n",
      "    * Understand HTTP status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.).\n",
      "    * Learn how to handle request headers.\n",
      "* **HTML Basics:**  You *need* a basic understanding of HTML.\n",
      "    * Tags, attributes, elements.\n",
      "    * How webpages are structured.\n",
      "    * Using your browser's developer tools (right-click -> Inspect) to examine the HTML of a webpage.\n",
      "* **Parsing HTML (with `BeautifulSoup`):**\n",
      "    * Load HTML content into a BeautifulSoup object.\n",
      "    * Use methods like `find()`, `find_all()`, `select()` to locate specific elements.\n",
      "    * Extract text, attributes, and data from those elements.\n",
      "* **Handling Pagination:** Many websites split content across multiple pages. Learn how to identify and follow pagination links.\n",
      "* **Storing Data:** Decide how you'll store the scraped data:\n",
      "    * **CSV files:** Simple, good for small datasets.\n",
      "    * **JSON files:**  Flexible, good for complex data.\n",
      "    * **Databases:**  (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)  Best for large datasets and complex queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Practice, Practice, Practice!**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Start Small:** Don't try to scrape a huge, complex website right away. Choose a simple website with a well-defined structure.\n",
      "* **Example Projects:**\n",
      "    * **Scrape product prices from an e-commerce site.**\n",
      "    * **Extract headlines from a news website.**\n",
      "    * **Collect data from a simple directory website.**\n",
      "* **Incrementally Increase Complexity:**  Once you're comfortable with the basics, tackle more challenging projects:\n",
      "    * Websites with dynamic content (use Selenium).\n",
      "    * Websites with forms (learn how to submit POST requests).\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. \\n\\nIn the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. \\n\\nIt has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel\\n\\nto hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA. Trading and more specifically, Nvidia, changed my entire life. Proudly riding with Jensen ',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&amp;lt;!-- SC_OFF --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=\"md\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n\\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n\\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n\\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;to hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA. Trading and more specifically, Nvidia, changed my entire life. Proudly riding with Jensen &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- SC_ON --&amp;gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'As a first time investor, I made the mistake of investing 30k at 37 years old into VOO around November 2024. I was DCAing about 5k per month and had hit about 50k before the market crashed in April. Unfortunately, I did not have a lot of cash on the sidelines and I wanted to build an emergency fund, so I did just that. I saved 15k, but I missed out on a lot of opportunities in the market. I did have a chance to buy Google, Amazon and VOO when the market was low, but not much (only 2500 of each). I have since added about another 5k of Google, 1k of Amazon, and 2.5k of UNH. I am only up 10% since November. I  feel bad seeing many people up 30% to 70% year to date, while I have nowhere near those returns. Unfortunately I did not have the cash ready to invest when the market was down, and chose to build an emergency fund instead. I also started a position in PLTR in November at $58 before buying VOO, but did not trust it and sold out due to fear of the unknown. As we all know now, that was a huge mistake. I am now focused on buying individual stocks, and will not make the same mistake of lump summing money into an ETF. What are some mistakes that you have made in the market? How did you learn and come back from them?\\n',\n",

I bought in just after Steve Jobs’s return to Apple and years before iPhones were even a glint in his eye.  Over the years AAPL has split multiple times and I have sold shares to pay for my D’s schooling and college and to buy other stocks like GOOG and FB, but if I had held onto all of the shares and reinvested the dividends it would be worth well north of $3,000,000.  My D’s stock account today is more than $1M and she’s still in her 20s, all a testament to a devoted buy-and-hold strategy.  (The other thing I like is that I have kept this in the same Fidelity account through thick and thin, so I can track the basis and return for all these investments down to the penny.).     ',\n",

(The other thing I like is that I have kept this in the same Fidelity account through thick and thin, so I can track the basis and return for all these investments down to the penny.).     &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- SC_ON --&amp;gt;',\n",

The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?
